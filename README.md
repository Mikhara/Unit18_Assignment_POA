These instructions are a guide for the employees of **ZBank** to experiement with a private testnet for the purposes of getting comfortable with blockhain and in particular crypto currency. They explain what has been done to set up the private testnet **zbanknet** and how to interact with it.


## Creating and Sending crypto currency via MyCrypto Wallet (an already existing testnet)


Create a MyCrypto Wallet in order to receive a public-private key needed for **zbanknet** later.

Also, if you would like to quickly see how to send and receive crypto, we can use an existing testnet via MyCrypto to get our first experience of sending and receiving crypto.


	* Download MyCrypto (https://www.mycrypto.com/) and creat a new wallet on one of the Ethereum testnets (I picked Rinkeby).
		* Screenshot 1
	* To pre-load the wallet, go to (https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) and tweet request with your account address copied.
	* Click on Transaction History on MyCrypto to see request status
		* Screenshot 2
	* Refresh Account Balance to see ETH come through
		* Screenshot 3
	* Share your Account address with colleagues to receive ETH
	* Paste your colleague's Account Address in "To" box in MyCrypto to send them ETH

**NB** The public-private key can be found in 'Wallet Info'. Copy your public and private key and store them somehwere same. Do not upload them to Github. Keep you private key secret. Do not upload your mneumonic to Github either.


## How I started the **bawsnet** test network

	1.
	1. Navigate to 'zbanknet' folder and click 'zbanknet.json' to see bawsnet Chain ID, Public address and Balance

	2. Note to see private key for each node, click into 'node1' or 'node2' folder and its 'keystore'
